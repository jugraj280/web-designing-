Dear [Mr.GRUNAM SINGH],<br><br>
</p>
<p class="main">
I’m writing to you regarding [COMPANY NAME]’s Web Developer opening, which I discovered on Indeed. I’ve been working as a <br>Web Developer at Grooming Technologies for more than 9 years now, and during that time I’ve revamped web security <br>applications, designed and developed a user-friendly website, and trained over 50 staff members in internal web functions.<br>I’m interested in working for [COMPANY NAME] because I want to further my own knowledge and interest in web development,<br> and I believe I’ll be able to offer new ideas to help [COMPANY NAME] reach and surpass the primary objectives mentioned <br>in its job .<br><br>

My core duties at Grooming Technologies included designing user interfaces, testing and debugging websites, and training<br> staff. Additionally, my work revamping our security applications diminished hacker attacks from 2.3% to 0.02%. I also <br>redesigned our website —increasing visitor clicks by 37% and customer purchases by 20%. Prior to this position, I worked at<br> Focus Solutions as a Web Developer where I assisted in developing a user friendly website that increased sales revenue <br>by 40%.<br><br>

This professional experience has helped me improve my skills in leadership, allowed me to gain mastery over necessary<br> development tools, and provided me with extensive knowledge of how to design a user friendly, secure website. I believe my<br> skill set will benefit [COMPANY NAME], which has the clear potential to increase online revenue and expand its audience.<br><br>

I’m looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident that I <br>fulfill the requirements for the Web Developer position. You can contact me at (123)-456-7890, or by email at <br>abcwebtech@gmail.com. If I have not heard from you in a week, I will reach out to you again. Thank you for your time and <br>consideration.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

JUGRAJ SINGH.<br><br>
