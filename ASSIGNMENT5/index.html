	<h1>WATERFALL MODEL</h1>
	<h3 class="text-danger">Considered to be the first major (widely known) model, each phase in this model must be completed before
the project may move to the next one, and no phases overlapping in possible. This is a sequential design process consisting in the following phases: conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance.</h3>

	<h1>V-SHAPED MODEL</h1>
	<h3 class="text-danger">Sometimes referred to as validation model or verification model, this is an expansion of the classic waterfall model. It is a very strict model where the next stage starts only after the previous one is finished. The
difference here being that every development stage has an associated test stage in order to ensure that the
conversion to the next stage is possible.</h3>

	<h1>ITRATIVE MODEL</h1>
	<h3 class="text-danger">The Iterative Model (or Incremental Model) is a system development life cycle model focusing on an initial
simplified implementation which then progressively gains complexity by adding features through a series of
planning, analysis, implementation, testing and evaluation phases happening several times.</h3>

<div class="container4">
	<h1>AGILE MODEL</h1>
	<h3 class="text-danger">Based on iterative and incremental development, this model requires a greater level of engagement from both
the customer and the team because the requirements for the project are not completely clear from the very
beginning. Collaboration between cross-functional teams is also a characteristic of this model.</h3>
