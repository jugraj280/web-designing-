ans 1 :XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. XML is a markup language much like HTML.
       XML was designed to store and transport data. XML was designed to be self-descriptive.
ans 2 :XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML. XSLT stands for XSL Transformations. 
      This tutorial will teach you how to use XSLT to transform
      XML documents into other formats (like transforming XML into HTML).
Ans 3. JSON is an open standard file format, and data interchange format,
      that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting
     of attribute–value pairs and array data types. It is a very common data
     format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as a
     replacement for XML in AJAX systems.
Ans 4. {"employees":[
          {"name":"Shami", "email":"shamimahajan@gmail.com"},
          {"name":"joban", "email":"jobanjeet32@gmail.com"},
          {"name":"Jaiveer", "email":"jaiveer87@gmail.com"},
       ]}
Ans 5. API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. An
      application programming interface is a computing interface that defines
      interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds
      of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats
      that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.
Ans 6. The HTML Browser API is an extension of the HTML <iframe>
       element that allows web apps to implement browsers or browser-like
       applications. It currently works in (privileged) chrome code on Firefox
      desktop.
Ans 7. Third party APIs are APIs provided by third parties — generally
       companies such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google — to allow you to access
       their functionality via JavaScript and use it on your site. One of the most
       obvious examples is using mapping APIs to display custom maps on your
       pages.

Ans 9. JSON is faster because it is designed specifically for data
       interchange. JSON encoding is terse, which requires less bytes for
       transit. JSON parsers are less complex, which requires less processing
       time and memory overhead.
       XML is slower, because it is designed for a lot more than just data
       interchange.
Ans 10. Because XML is a poor choice for files which must be maintained
        by humans. There is no visual separation between the markup and the
        content, making it hard to read. It is tedious to write correctly without a
        special-purpose editor. Any error in an XML document is fatal;
        an XML document cannot be partially processed.
