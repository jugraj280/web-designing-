                                                       FINAL EXAM 
ANS1: Angular, React and Vue are all highly popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks that
help developers build complex, reactive and modern user interfaces for the web. Actually, with
additional libraries like React Native Ionic (With Angular or With React)Native React or you can
even build native mobile apps for mobile devices with help of Angular, React and Vue. In this
article, we’ll not really look at Why you would need such a framework. I’ll also not start
explaining those libraries here - for that, you can check out other resources, like my courses on
those topics (Angular,React,Vue - all included in our pro subscription of course). Instead, I want
to share some thoughts on how those frameworks and libraries compare and which of the three
you might want to choose for your next project. I also want to mention that there are other,
smaller, libraries or technologies like svelte which do similar things. I do have a comparison on
Svelte vs angular etc as well. 

ANS2 :Syntax (details): Angular uses TypeScript and splits HTML + TypeScript logic apart, React
uses JavaScript and a feature called “JSX” (it combines “HTML” and JavaScript logic),vue uses
regular JavaScript and splits HTML + JavaScript logic apart. 

ANS3 : SCSS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading
Style Sheets. SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The
original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar.

ANS5 : The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of
control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and
where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. 

ANS 6:The HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or
more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the element: the browser will choose
the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream . 

ANS7 : Video element ( ) 

ANS 8: The HTML element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. The element is
only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has
several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images. 

ANS9 :
 1.Animation name: declares the name of the @keyframes at-rule to manipulate.
 2.Animation duration the length of time it takes for an animation to complete one cycle.
 3.Animation-timing: establishes preset acceleration curves such as Ease or liner. 
 4.Animation direction: sets the direction of the animation after the cycle. Its default resets on
   each cycle.
 5.Animation iration count: the number of times the animation should be performed.
 6.Animation fill mode: sets which values are applied before/after the animation. For example,
   you can set the last state of the animation to remain on screen, or you can set it to switch back to
   before when the animation began.
