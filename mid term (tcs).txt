       $first_number = 10;
       $second_number = 20;
       $multiple of 2 no is = $second_number * $first_number;
       print ($multiple of 2 no is);
       ?>
ans 10 :An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of values in a single value. 
        For example if you want to store 100 numbers then instead of defining 100 variables its easy to define
        an array of 100 length.
